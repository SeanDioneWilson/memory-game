# Memory Game Project

## My finished version

This is my attempt at a functional memory game project. In order to test it out, all ou have to do is clone the code and run the index.html in a web browser making sure the css and js files are linked correctly. 

For this project I used a bunch of external resources to understand everything that went in. I followed along with a very helpful walkthrough and made git commits along the way. I also commented on my js code to make it very understandable what each block of code is responsible for. 

After 11/14/2018 I plan on revisiting this code and making it unique. I'll change a lot of the styling and challenge myself to refactor the code.
